# Treelight Software Sites

This repository holds the unified landing pages for Treelight Software, KDojang, TLSchedule, and ChapTrack.

## Building

We rewrote the sites in late 2020 to use "boring" technologies, our own template, and our own code. This enabled us to avoid lengthy builds or inconsistencies across platforms.

Treelight Software is hosted at the root. Each product is a subfolder. On deploy, Netlify checks out the code and directs the appropriate subdomain to the right place.
